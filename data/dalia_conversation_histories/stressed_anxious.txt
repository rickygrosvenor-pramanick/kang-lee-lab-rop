Therapist: Welcome back. How are you doing today?
Student: It’s just this constant worry that I’m not doing enough. Even when I’m working on assignments, I feel like I’m not doing them well or fast enough.
Therapist: I see. Anxiety can often make us feel like we’re not meeting expectations, even when we’re putting in effort. How does this anxiety show up for you physically?
Student: My heart races a lot, and I feel really tense. Sometimes I can’t focus because I’m thinking about all the things that could go wrong.
Therapist: It sounds like your mind is in overdrive, which makes it hard to stay grounded. Have you found anything that helps calm those anxious thoughts?
Student: Not really. I usually just try to push through, but that doesn’t seem to help.
Therapist: That’s understandable. When anxiety builds, it’s important to find ways to calm your body and mind. One thing we could try is a grounding exercise. Would you be open to that?
Student: Sure, I’ll try anything at this point.
Therapist: Great. Let’s start with some deep breathing. Inhale slowly through your nose for four counts, hold for a moment, and exhale slowly through your mouth for four counts. Let’s do this a few times together.
Student: (Breathes deeply) That feels a little better.
Therapist: I’m glad to hear that. Sometimes just slowing down and focusing on your breath can help reduce the intensity of anxiety. You can practice this whenever you’re feeling overwhelmed.
Student: I think I’ll try that more often. It’s simple, but I already feel a bit calmer.
Therapist: I’m glad it helped. Another thing to consider is how we can shift the way you approach your workload. When anxiety is high, we often put extra pressure on ourselves. Do you feel like you’re setting really high expectations?
Student: Definitely. I feel like if I don’t do everything perfectly, I’m failing.
Therapist: That’s a lot of pressure to carry. One thing we can work on is setting more realistic goals and giving yourself permission to make mistakes. What do you think?
Student: It’s hard to let go of the need to be perfect, but I think it would help me feel less anxious.
Therapist: Exactly. Perfectionism can feed anxiety. By setting achievable goals and focusing on progress instead of perfection, you might find it easier to manage both the stress and the anxiety.
Student: I like that idea. I need to learn how to be okay with "good enough."
Therapist: That’s a great insight. It’s about finding balance. Let’s also talk about self-compassion—treating yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend who’s going through a tough time.
Student: I’m definitely hard on myself, so I could work on that.
Therapist: It’s a process, but small shifts in how you talk to yourself can make a big difference. We’ll keep working on strategies to manage both the stress and the anxiety. How does that sound?
Student: That sounds good. I already feel better just talking about it.
